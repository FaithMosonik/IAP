            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <div>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Maathai was born on 1 April 1940 in the village of Ihithe, Nyeri District, in the central highlands of the colony of Kenya. <br>
                    Her family was Kikuyu, the most populous ethnic group in Kenya, and had lived in the area for several generations. <br>
                    Around 1943, Maathai's family relocated to a White-owned farm in the Rift Valley, near Nakuru, where her father had found work.
                </p>
                <h3>Education and Work Lfe</h3>
                <p>
                    Late in 1947, she returned to Ihithe with her mother, as two of her brothers were attending primary school in the village, and there was no schooling available on the farm where her father worked. <br>
                    Her father remained at the farm. Shortly afterward, at the age of eight years, she joined her brothers at Ihithe Primary School. <br>
                    At 11 years, Maathai moved to St. Cecilia's Intermediate Primary School, a boarding school at the Mathari Catholic Mission in Nyeri.[11] Maathai studied at St. Cecilia's for four years. <br>
                    During this time, she became fluent in English and converted to Catholicism. She was involved with the Legion of Mary, whose members attempted "to serve God by serving fellow human beings." <br> 
                    Studying at St. Cecilia's, she was sheltered from the ongoing Mau Mau uprising, which forced her mother to move from their homestead to an emergency village in Ihithe. <br> 
                    When she completed her studies there in 1956, she was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school for girls in Kenya, Loreto High School in Limuru. <br>
                    Maathai became one of some 300 Kenyans selected to study in the United States in September 1960. <br>
                    She received a scholarship to study at Mount St. Scholastica College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, Kansas, where she majored in biology, with minors in chemistry and German. <br>
                    After receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1964, she studied at the University of Pittsburgh for a master's degree in biology. <br> 
                    Her graduate studies there were funded by the Africa-America Institute, and during her time in Pittsburgh, she first experienced environmental restoration, when local environmentalists pushed to rid the city of air pollution. <br>
                    In January 1966, Maathai received her MSc in biological sciences, and was appointed to a position as research assistant to a professor of zoology at University College of Nairobi. <br>
                    In 1967, at the urging of Professor Hofmann, she travelled to the University of Giessen in Germany in pursuit of a doctorate. She studied both at Giessen and the University of Munich. <br>
                    In the spring of 1969, she returned to Nairobi to continue her studies at the University College of Nairobi as an assistant lecturer. <br>
                    In 1971, she became the first Eastern African woman to receive a Ph.D., her doctorate in veterinary anatomy,from the University College of Nairobi, which became the University of Nairobi the following year. <br>
                    She completed her dissertation on the development and differentiation of gonads in bovines.[
                </p>
                <h3>Marriage life</h3>
                <p>
                    In April 1966, she met Mwangi Mathai, another Kenyan who had studied in America, who would later become her husband. <br>
                    They had three children, two daughters and a son; Wanjira Mathai, Muta Mathai and Waweru Mathai. <br>
                    Wangari and her husband, Mwangi, separated in 1977 and after a two-year separation, he filed for a divorce in 1979. <br>
                    Mwangi was said to have believed that Wangari was "too strong-minded for a woman" and that he was "unable to control her" <br>
                    He also accused her wife of infidelity as he claimed he was cheating on him with another Member of Parliament, which in turn, was thought to cause his high blood pressure. <br>
                    After a much-publicised messy divorce, Mwangi, through his lawyer, asked Wangari to drop the surname Mathai as they were no longer married. <br>
                    Being the smart woman she was, Wangari had something up her sleeve, instead of changing her name, she added an extra ‘a’ in the name Mathai after the letter ‘M’ making her surname, Maathai.
                </p>
                <h3>Late life</h3>
                <p>
                    Wangari Muta Maathai, the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, environmentalist and human rights activist, died 25 September at age 71. <br>
                    During her last days, even as she battled ovarian cancer in a Nairobi hospital, Ms. Maathai reiterated her wish that she must not be buried in a wooden coffin — thereby reaffirming her life-long battle <br>
                    to save trees and the rest of the environment.

                <ul>
                    <li>                  
                        Wangari Maathai was active in the National Council of Women of Kenya in 1976-87 and was its chairman in 1981-87. 
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        It was while she served in the National Council of Women that she introduced the idea of planting trees with the people in 1976 <br>
                        and continued to develop it into a broad-based, grassroots organization whose main focus is the planting of trees with women groups in order to conserve the environment and improve their quality of life. <br>
                        However, through the Green Belt Movement she has assisted women in planting more than 20 million trees on their farms and on schools and church compounds.
                        In 1986, the Movement established a Pan African Green Belt Network and has exposed over 40 individuals from other African countries to the approach. <br>
                        Some of these individuals have established similar tree planting initiatives in their own countries or they use some of the Green Belt Movement methods to improve their efforts. <br>
                        So far some countries have successfully launched such initiatives in Africa (Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Lesotho, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, etc).

                    <li>
                        In September 1998, she launched a campaign of the Jubilee 2000 Coalition.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        She has embarked on new challenges, playing a leading global role as a co-chair of the Jubilee 2000 Africa Campaign, which seeks cancellation of the unpayable backlog debts of the poor countries in Africa by the year 2000. <br>
                        Her campaign against land grabbing and rapacious allocation of forests land has caught the limelight in the recent past.
